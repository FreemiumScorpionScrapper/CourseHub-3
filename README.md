* Project Description
We are looking to build a website where students are able to view and/or provide reviews for UBC courses. The application will store Course related data such as Course Number, Course Name, Relevant Link and its corresponding reviews. Reviews include comments regarding course content, difficulty as well as work load. Users will be able to view the data on a specific Course. They would also be able to filter and/or search for specific courses. We are also hoping to add several other features such as a button for users to report issues and adding historical data(averages, max, min) of course.
